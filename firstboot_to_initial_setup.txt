RHEL7 firstboot migration

General
=======

Firstboot has been replaced with "initial setup".
https://github.com/rhinstaller/initial-setup
(rhel7-branch)

initial-setup runs on firstboot, and can use data
collected in anaconda to do configuration. install-setup
modules are based on anaconda addons.


The Bad
=======


pygtk/gtk compatability:

    subscription-manager-gui is based on pygtk2.
    initial-setup is based on pygtk3 and gobject-introspection.

    They are not particular compatible, and shouldn't be used
    in the same process. ie, we need to port the gui to pygtk3,
    or write new pygtk3 based gui for initial setup.

gui flow:

    initial-setup is based on a hub and spoke gui flow, which
    is different from the "wizard" approach of previous firstboot
    modules. 

    TBD: if we can adapt to this approach

tui/script support:

    Generally initial-setup modules are meant to gather some
    info, and then basically add it to a kickstart file to be
    ran in one go.

    Depending on the level of ui sophistication we want, this
    might be difficult.
